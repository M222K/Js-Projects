whenever we make a web request to a server or third party application:
-server can throw some error
-your databse is always in different continent , it can take some time to fetch the databse

thus-> try to encapsulate everything in try and catch to handle errors

- in order to fetch data from app javascript alone cannot do that , we need window or browser env for this
so we genearlly use FETCH API
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

-in order to understand the API RESPONSES of many web app/llms we can use JSON response formatter to understand what data type and which prperty to extract to get the value.
